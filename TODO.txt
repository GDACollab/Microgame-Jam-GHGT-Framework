- WinWithTransition() or LoseWithTransition()?
- Minify all .js and .css for web build?
- Difficulty increment code (set difficulty to 1 if the browser doesn't detect the game as having been played before?)
- Some kind of volume slider (at least for main menu stuff?). Could work with other games' audio, but that could be inconsistent.

Future Improvements:
- Upgrade to typescript?

- Transition animator workflow

- For Godot, add Brotli or .gzip compressions to builds to reduce filesize? Include web server in extension so that people can easily test out their results?

Relevant guide for Brotli: https://gist.github.com/Calinou/30f21f07017d908fc74c7eccb3f469c3 Should work with new version, provided web server is configured correctly?

Relevant guide for GZIP: https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/8b67lb/guide_how_to_compress_wasmpck_file_to_make_html5/ Needs to be updated to use new builds.

- Asynchronous loading across extensions. Requires analysis of each engine though, and finding the exact point in their .wasm or .js file to pause until they're ready to play. Honestly it would be a huge pain, and we'd end up losing support for a lot of .JS engines (since we'd have to each configure them manually). Possible idea: Run the iframes in some kind of VM, find the exact point where "gameStart" is ready to go, then load that state into the iframe? I have no idea how that'd work in-browser though. I mean, if there were some way to pause iframes, it would be a whole lot simpler.
