[Menu]
; Certain important pieces will be specially marked.

; Play button:

[Menu.playButton]
img = Play.png
offset = (60,250,3) ; Offset goes (x, y, layer). Max X is 960, Max Y is 540. For layer, higher values are towards the front. Lower values are towards the back.

; Credits button:

[Menu.creditsButton]
img = Credits.png
offset = (300,380,3)

; The rest is miscellaneous art. You only need add "Art.ID" for each thing you want to add, with

; img = image-name (located in jam/version-assets/art/)
; offset = (x, y, layer)

; You can also customize the CSS for each art with the class .menu-art and the id #ID from above (the ID in Art.ID). 

[Menu.background]
img = desk-background.png
offset = (0, 0, -1)

[Menu.gda-chan]

[Transitions]
debug = none ; Set to "win" to debug win transitions on loop, set to "lose" to debug lose transitions on loop. Set to "" or any other value to debug nothing.
debug-loop = loop ; Set to "loop-end" to allow the animation to infinitely loop at the end. Set to "loop" to let the animation play normally (but restart after it finishes). Set to "pause" to "freeze" at the end of the animation (it actually just leaves animation settings at the end. Infinitely looping iterations will continue to loop). Set to "none" or any other value to allow the animation to play normally.

; Pulls from jam-version-assets/art/transitions/


; This will pull images directly from /art/transitions/IMAGE_NAME
; Same with Transitions.Lives
; Class will be .transition-art and id is #ID (from Transitions.ID).

; There are three pieces common to win and lose, so we add them here first.
; For these upcoming transitions, you'll want to create offsets that are offscreen so you can move them on-screen during CSS:

[Transitions.background-1]
img = leftbg_colorful paper.png
; Just so you know, if you set the offsets OFFSCREEN, you'll have to compensate with transitions during the animation that are equally far.
offset = (-570, 0, 0)

; Just like with Menu, you can create multiple pieces of art.

; This is for hearts to be displayed:
[Transitions.background-paper]
img = upbg_rippedgraphpaper.png
; Animate to Transform(200px, 400px) to get to (-200, -400) (which I think is the correct position.) Gives us a nice slide-in-from-the-corner effect.
offset = (-400, -850, 0)

[Transitions.gda-chan-idle]
img = gda idle.png
offset = (700, 540, 0)

[Transitions.Lives]
; These images will have the .lives-transition-art class. 
; I don't think I'll add separability to this (just lostLife, since the heart fractures).
life = intact heart.png
lifeOffset = (0, 0, 0)
; No idea how this will work for future versions. Right now, I'll just make an animation for when you lose your heart. Multiple assets separated by comma:
lostLife = ripped heart left side only.png,ripped heart right side only.png
lostLifeOffset = (0, 0, 0),(0, 0, 0)
; Then we can animate in CSS.

; Class is .win-transition-art and id is #ID (from Transitions.Win.ID).
; Pull from /art/transitions/win/IMAGE_NAME
[Transitions.Win]
